# Dynamic geospatial model of IMPaCS, using the size-frequency distribution of impacts scaled from the lunar surface, we generate the volume and abundance of this enriched crust on Earthâ€™s surface during the Hadean to determine how rapidly it evolved.

#### Probability of impact through the 500 Million Year Hadean period.
